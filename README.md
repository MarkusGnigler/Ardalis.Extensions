# Ardalis.Extensions
Some random C# extension methods I've found useful. Published as Ardalis.Extensions on Nuget.


## Conventions

Methods that go together or have a common purpose should be placed into their own separate file named accordingly. All classes that have extension methods in them should have an `Extensions` suffix. Only one class per file.
